<h1>BIOL 3004 COURSE DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The goal of BIOL 3004 is to provide you with an authentic research experience within the context of a teaching lab. In the first half of the course you will be working independently and together in a group to gain the basic skills and knowledge that you will need for the second half of the course where you will develop and conduct your own research project, the results of which you will describe in the format of a scientific manuscript. You will be working in groups of 3-4 for many of the in-class and homework assignments, quizzes, and your research projects.</p>

<p>By participating in this class you will be an active participant in scientific research at the University of Minnesota, helping to establish a new research system for students at the university, based on work in Dr. Ran Blekhman’s lab in the departments of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior and Cellular Development and Genetics. You’ll have the opportunity to design your own study to address questions that interest you, the results of which will be new to science! </p>

<p>In BIOL 2002 you were introduced to various aspects of biology and developed technical and analytical skills. This latter half of this semester is structured like a working research lab where your instructors will serve as advisors to help you plan and execute your study. As such, you will be required to do background reading, maintain a lab notebook, and participate in discussions about your work. Like all research, you will encounter problems that you will have to work through to solve. It is important to keep in mind that encountering problems and struggling with them does not mean you are bad at research – it’s part of the process. The key is trying to solve those problems through asking questions and seeking help. </p>

<p>Science at it’s best is collaborative and you will have many opportunities to work with others in this course. You will get feedback from your peers and instructors on your assignments and your writing. The objectives are to challenge you to explore the topics addressed in the course, to develop your ability to work as a member of a team, to help you improve your writing and, most importantly, to aid you in performing your own research. The skills you develop and practice in this course will be invaluable whether your career path takes you into a university research lab, graduate school, industry, or fields outside of the sciences. </p>

<p>Scientific research is not just designing and performing experiments; it also entails creative and critical thinking, literature research, written documentation of methods, and analysis and presentation of results. Writing is essential to the process of learning and scientific inquiry. Because of its role in scientific communication, writing will comprise an important component of BIOL 3004. The writing assignments in this course include your lab notebook and a research paper describing the results of your study. The ultimate goal of this writing is for you to bring together material from the literature and your own ideas to articulate your hypotheses and results to others. You will develop the ability to communicate findings effectively to a scientific audience, and practice a writing style that’s typical of the biological sciences. This work will help you develop critical skills identified by faculty in the College of Biological Sciences as part of the Writing Enriched Curriculum (WEC) project. </p>
