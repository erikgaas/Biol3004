 More About How R Actually Works:

 Try to separate concepts from the words used to represent them:
</h2>
<p>
 One of the most difficult things about learning a programming language (or spoken language for that matter) is learning the grammar, syntax, and odd traditions they use to convey information. Spoken languages have certain peculiarities. Some have very different usages depending on tense and conjugation. Some strategies can even be misleading. ‘La tortuga’ in French means ‘The turtle’. But ‘La’ is a feminine preposition. Does that mean there are only female turtles? Well no. Of course not. You would think that programming languages are much practical in how they express information. In large part this is true, every command must eventually translate to ones and zeros. But since programming languages are also developed by humans, there are going to be ambiguities and idiosyncrasies that are introduced naturally. My point here is to take any programming language’s style with a grain of salt. There are so many ways of doing the same thing computationally and if you think something is a little weird, many other people do too. And none of you would be wrong. So to be a good programmer I would just give you this advice. Be skeptical about any particular programming language philosophy and think about ways you would do things differently. At the same time, somewhat schizophrenically, trust that the decision made by the programming language is the correct one and search for reasons why it is effective. If you can abstract away the actually process from the information conveying strategy, this will be very helpful in the long term.

 Okay actual programming now:
</h2>
<p>
 Compared to other programming languages, R is somewhat unusual. Think about how you would develop a programming language. You would probably start out with calculator-like functionality, getting simple operations between numbers working. (Remember computers cannot represent infinitely long numbers. So you would probably represent numbers differently depending on size or how many numbers past the decimal point they would have.) R is different in that it says “No! Data always goes with other data!” There is no such thing as a single number in its representation scheme. There only exists collections of data. The loophole is we can have a collection of data with only one number in it. This philosophy has a great advantage in that it is directly applicable to the kind of data analysis we want to do. Let’s return to the iris dataset. You might have wondered how R represents this data. (Or not. Whatever.) We can find more information about this iris dataset by typing:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">str(iris)
</code></pre>
<p>
 Which returns:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
 $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...
 $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...
 $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...
 $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels "setosa","versicolor",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
</code></pre>
<p>
 The ‘str’ stands for structure, and will give you information about any piece of data. In this case it gives us information about the column names and how many rows of data there are. Notice that the first thing it tells us is that the data is represented within a data frame. I like to think about a data frame as you would think about a table of data in an Excel document. Just like molecules are made from atoms, a data frame is made up of smaller collections of data. In this case it is apparent that these smaller collections of data are the columns of data in the dataset. If we wanted to we could strip out a column from a data frame as just a vector of numbers. (A vector is just an ordered collection of data. In this case it is numbers, but it could be letters, words, or True/False values as well.) We have in fact already done this when using the qplot function:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">iris$Sepal.Length
</code></pre>
<p>
 This notation was meant to say “Strip out the Sepal.Length column from the iris data frame and put them into a vector.” We can verify this by using the str function again.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">str(iris$Sepal.Length)
</code></pre>
<p>
 Which returns:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">num [1:150] 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
</code></pre>
<p>
 We see this is 150 element vector of numbers. If we wanted to make our own vector we could use the c function:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">c(1,2,3,4)
</code></pre>
<p>
 If you want to verify that this indeed correct, use the str function again.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">str(c(1,2,3,4))
</code></pre>
<p>
 Returning:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">num [1:4] 1 2 3 4
</code></pre>
<p>
 The c typically stands for “concatenation”, meaning to put things together. I prefer to think of it as representing “collection” as it is sort of the fundamental atom for data in R. If you do not believe me, consider a single number. Say 7. Let’s look at the structure of just seven.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">str(7)
</code></pre>
<p>
 It turns out this is identical to:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">str(c(7))
</code></pre>
<p>
 We can verify this with the ‘==’ operator, which tests for equality between two different data objects.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">str(7) == str(c(7))
</code></pre>
<p>
 Or simply just
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">7 == c(7)
</code></pre>
<p>
 The computer says this is TRUE, so they are indeed equal.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">[1] TRUE
</code></pre>
<p>
 That was kind of weird though. Why did we use two equals signs to represent equality? Should one equals sign have sufficed? It turns out a long time ago some programmer decided that ‘=’ would be reserved to represent assignment, not equality. Remember back to last lesson when we performed this command:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data=iris, color=Species)
</code></pre>
<p>
 In this case the equals sign was used to assign the data and color parameters the data in iris and Species respectively. When say ‘data=iris’ we are saying “Take the
 <strong>
  data
 </strong>
 parameter and assign to it all of the information that Species currently points to!” Be careful here because order matters in assignment. If we said ‘iris=data’ meaning “Take the iris parameter and assign it to whatever information data currently points to!” This means something completely different. In this case the computer would spit out an error telling you that qplot has no such ‘iris’ parameter and that you don’t have any data stored in something called
 <strong>
  data
 </strong>
 so what are you even talking about?
</p>
<p>
 Now here is where R gets even more bizarre. At some point someone figured that using ‘=’ for assignment is confusing and decided that it would be much better to use ‘&lt;-‘. Let’s try this out by assigning c(2,3,5,7) to the variable name ‘primes’.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">primes &lt;- c(2,3,5,7)
</code></pre>
<p>
 We can now use the word primes any time we like within functions, just like we could use iris to represent some gigantic data frame. So ‘&lt;-‘ became the preferred way to assign data to variable names, but ‘=’ still retains the same functionality, so
</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">primes = c(2,3,5,7)
</code></pre>
<p>
 is exactly the same command. At this point the consensus in the community is that it is best if you use ‘&lt;-‘ when assigning data to a variable name like in ‘primes &lt;- c(2,3,5,7)’, but better to use ‘=’ when assigning data to a parameter in a function like we did with data and color in ‘qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data=iris, color=Species)’. This mode of thinking is completely arbitrary so it is really up to you how you decide to write your code. Consider for yourself. What do you think the best style would be?
</p>
<h2>
 Recap:
</h2>
<p>
 This was a big section, so let’s quickly restate what we have learned.
</p>
<p>
 Data in R is represented as collections of data always.
</p>
<p>
 Vectors are the simplest way to have a collection of data.
</p>
<p>
 A data frame (like iris) is made up of smaller collections of data pasted together.
</p>
<p>
 The str function can be used to gain information about a particular structure of data. (ie vector, data frame, and others we have not covered yet.)
</p>
<p>
 We can make things easier by taking complicated data structures and assigning them to a short variable name for quick and easy reference later.
</p>
<p>
 ‘&lt;-‘ is the primary assignment operator, used typically in the general body of your code. ‘primes &lt;- c(2,3,5,7)’
</p>
<p>
 ‘=’ is also used for assignment, but is typically used to assign values to parameters within function arguments. ‘qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data=iris, color=Species)’
</p>
<p>
 Remember when I said R is like exploring a large castle? We have already seen circumstances where concepts gain importance through the lens of a different concept. With all that said, the best thing you can do before the next lesson is to go exploring and find some new interesting perspectives. You will certainly find some. Be sure to share them with your peers as well!
